/**

 * @whatItDoes manually injects {@link SelectControlValueAccessor} into <option> tags to make
 * them work with {@link SelectComponent}
 *
 * @howToUse Should work automatically for every option element which is provided as ng-content
 * for ext-select
 *
 * This directive is injected with parent {@link SelectComponent}, if it is not null then manual injection
 * into NgSelectOption directive is performed (as well as setting id)
 * BEWARE - this reimplements {@link NgSelectOption} constructor, so it is very prone to angular updates.
 *
 * As everything is done in constructor, overriding @Input value and @Input ngValue is not required,
 * as at that time NgSelectOption will have manually injected {@link SelectControlValueAccessor}
 *
 * Testing should be done as part of the {@link SelectComponent}
