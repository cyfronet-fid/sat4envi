# Seed 1

This seed is compatible with `local-dataset-1`, and will work with CEPH bucket `s3-cloud/s4e-sync-1`.

However, CEPH bucket doesn't have corrected `Opad_H05_XXh` products (as of 2020-08-28), so the following
4 products' scenes will not be present: `Opad_H05_03h`, `Opad_H05_06h`, `Opad_H05_12h` and `Opad_H05_24h`.
